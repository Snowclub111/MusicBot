# A Discord Music Bot written in JavaScript, the discord.js library and discord.js-commando framework

[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/made-with-javascript.svg)](https://forthebadge.com)

### Installing the dependencies

`npm i`

### Setup

Make a config.json file in the root directory of the project and add:

```
{
  "prefix": "!",  // You can change the prefix to whatever you want it doesn't have to be - !
  "token": "Your-Bot-Token",
  "tenorAPI": "tenor-API-key",
  "newsAPI": "news-api-key",
  "youtubeAPI": "youtube-api-key",
  "yandexAPI": "yandex-api-key",
  "geniusLyricsAPI": "genius-api-key"
}
```

I run the bot on a debian 9 environment so it might not work as intended on other operating systems, if you need a guide on how to install node.js on debian 9 or ubuntu I will link one in the resources down below.

Also, no matter what operating system you have, make sure [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) and [python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) are installed.

If you are not cloning this repo, make sure your dependencies versions are the same as this repo's.
